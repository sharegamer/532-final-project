The plan is to implement a recommendation algorithm on the MIND dataset (https://msnews.github.io/), which includes two datasets: train and dev. The algorithm will utilize CBF (TF-IDF + Entity) + CF (ALS) + Knowledge-Aware, and Spark will be used to optimize the data processing. The implementation steps will be planned out and a .md file generated, followed by step-by-step implementation. The requirements include saving the trained model and outputting test results, providing a user-friendly UI to display the results and effects, evaluating the results using multiple metrics, demonstrating the effectiveness of Spark optimization, and ideally providing a real-time demo. The main file (.ipynb) should be used, and the remaining files (.py) should be used. The file structure should be concise, the code clear, and error-free. Test cases should be written to validate the code, and the impact of different parameter choices should be tested. All outputs should be presented clearly and concisely, focusing on key elements rather than overwhelming the user.
